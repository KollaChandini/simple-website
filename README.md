## Project1: To run a simple website
This project is about how to run a website on a Linux vm with Ubuntu, Vagrant and Apache HTTP Server.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

VirtualBox - A virtualization platform

Vagrant - A tool for building and managing virtual machine environments
Basic understanding of the Linux command line
## What I did
In this project, I created a ubuntu vm with the help of vagrant and virtual box. Then I accessed the virtual machine environment(vm) by running vagrant ssh from the terminal. 

To install Apache I used ubuntu's package manager which is called apt.

Then I set up networking to access my web server from outside the vm. 
After I set up the networking configuration successfully i could able to access my web server, running inside a Linux virtual Machine, on my laptop.

After that I changed the default website content by adding my own website to it.

## Automation
Add the code that you do manually in the vagrant file. Then validate the vagrant file. Then run vagrant up command. You will see that what you did manually will be automated.
